# Study-with-this

- A lightweight Pomodoro + lofi app: Pomodoro helper should not be resource-hungry 😂.
- A weekend side project, recreating [study-with-me-with-this](https://github.com/stannam/study-with-me-with-this).
- The child of a sleepless Friday night, written for fun to make something I'd actually use and to practice C + SDL2.

# Features

- Helps with the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)  
  - During a work session, the red circle shrinks and local lofi music plays continuously.  
  - During a break session, the circle regrows.  
- 𝓣𝓱𝓪𝓽'𝓼 𝓲𝓽!

# Why recreate SWMWT?
1. Why not?  
2. SWMWT is written in Python + PyQt5, which  
   - takes soooooo long (~10 seconds) to launch.
   - was tricky to get running on Ubuntu.
